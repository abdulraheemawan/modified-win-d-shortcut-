# modified-win-d-shortcut

The problem with win+d shortcut is that it doesnot remember the windows and the state that they are in when you do something on desktop after pushing win+d.
This code works with autohotkey and works like the mac shortcut which lets you manipulate the desktop and do stuff after initial launch and then get back to
all the windows after you're done. Uses the memory fuctioj to remember the windows and the state they're in.
